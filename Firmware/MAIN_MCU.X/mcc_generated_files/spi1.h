  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the SPI1 driver using MPLAB® Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for SPI1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB® Code Configurator - v2.25.2
        Device            :  PIC24FJ128GA310
